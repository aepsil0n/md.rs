even here

    and code blocks
    too

regular text *with emphasis* and __more emphasis__ here
even inline `code blocks`  ``are allowed``

they also handle **code `blocks`inside ``emphasis``**

they ignore _emphasis [in_]   [links]_ yeah

links are [now] (http://parsed)

even with titles [body](  <http://link> 'title')

Wonderful [x]  eee

Setext headers
also
